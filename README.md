<b>To do List project</b>

<p>This mini app enables you to add a task to the list and complete it. You can filter them between: <b>All, Completed</b> and <b>Uncompleted.</b>
You will be able to delete the to do you created with the trash can icon, or check the tick button to complete it. When the page is refreshed you will still see the list, as it is saved in your local storage.
My personal goals when creating this was to understand:
<ul>
    <li>How to create variables.</li>
     <li>How to create event listeners with a click function.</li>
     <li>What functions are.</li>
     <li>Creating divs dynamically and appending them to their parent.</li>
     <li>Local storage, and how to use it.</li>
</ul>
</p>
